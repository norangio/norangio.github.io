# Projects

A selection of projects that highlight my work at the intersection of data science and bioprocess engineering.

## Drug product comparability & statistical analysis (AstraZeneca)
**Role:** Principal Engineer, Data Science — led comparability strategy for manufacturing changes

- Led drug product comparability strategy and statistical analysis supporting multiple manufacturing process changes and site transfers for a lead cell therapy asset.
- Led drafting of comparability sections for IND amendment submissions and other regulatory filings, translating statistical results into regulator-ready narratives.
- Designed equivalence testing strategies, tolerance interval analyses, and comparability frameworks to support regulatory submissions.
- Collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders (CMC, quality, clinical) to align on data-driven comparability arguments.

**Skills / tools:** Equivalence testing, tolerance intervals, regulatory CMC strategy, Snowflake, statistical reporting and visualizations.

## NGS assay development & cloud bioinformatics pipelines (Resilience)
**Role:** Senior Data Scientist & Product Owner — led R&D team developing NGS assays

- Led a cross-functional R&D team and product ownership for next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays supporting CAR T-cell manufacturing.
- Delivered a multimodal single-cell transcriptomic + proteomic assay and a sterility/microbial detection NGS assay (microbial assay: see patent reference).
- Built cloud-based pipelines (Nextflow on AWS), automation for QC, and reproducible analysis workflows in R/Python.

**Skills / tools:** NGS assay design, Nextflow, AWS, single-cell analysis, R, Python, reproducible pipelines, patent (microbial detection assay).

## Statistical process monitoring & manufacturing analytics (Poseida Therapeutics)
**Role:** Lead engineer, MSAT Data Science — built and led statistical process monitoring (SPM) program

- Designed and implemented a statistical process monitoring program after joining as the first MSAT hire.
- Led manufacturing investigations and partnered with clinical/translational teams to identify incoming material attributes (IMAs) associated with manufacturing performance for autologous CAR T-cell therapy.
- Implemented SPC methods and variance component analyses to enable early detection of process shifts and support root cause analysis.

**Skills / tools:** SPC, variance components, statistical modeling, process capability analysis, Python/R, data integration from LIMS and historians.

## Tech transfer: chromatography resin change (Eli Lilly)
**Role:** Technical lead, chromatography resin change for a commercial recombinant peptide (tech transfer to CDMO)

- Led the technical transfer and process qualification activities for a chromatography resin change at a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO).
- Coordinated cross-functional teams (process, QC, quality, CDMO) to ensure continuity of supply and regulatory readiness.
- Outcomes: successful scale-up and validation enabling continued commercial manufacture with minimal disruption.

**Skills / tools:** Process scale-up, tech transfer, CDMO oversight, process validation, GMP documentation.

Would you like each project to link to a deeper write-up, code sample, or a downloadable one-page case study? I can draft short case studies for any projects you pick.
