This is a short test post to make sure everything is wired correctly:
- the `_posts` folder is rendering
- the **Work & Writing** page is picking up posts
- Google Analytics is tracking page views
- formatting doesn’t look cursed

## Why this post exists

This post exists for exactly one reason: to verify that the writing workflow works end-to-end before spending real effort on content.

If you’re reading this later, congratulations. The pipeline worked.

## What’s working so far
- Posts render using the `single` layout
- URLs are generated correctly
- Excerpts appear on the Work & Writing page
- Page views are tracked independently in GA

This post will probably be deleted later. Or not.
