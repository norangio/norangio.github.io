With 12+ years of experience across biotech startups and global pharma, I specialize in data science, process development, manufacturing, and CMC strategy for biologics and cell therapies. I have led technical initiatives spanning from R&D to GMP clinical and commercial manufacturing, from process development through successful regulatory submissions, with deep experience translating complex data into regulatory-ready CMC strategy.

I bring years of hands-on experience in computational and analytical pipeline development, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing, QC, and analysis workflows supporting cell therapy R&D and manufacturing. This includes designing and maintaining scalable data pipelines, integrating assay, sequencing, and manufacturing data, and applying statistical and computational methods to drive process understanding, comparability, and decision-making.

I also have extensive experience implementing digital and data systems across R&D and manufacturing environments, including cloud platforms, data infrastructures, and advanced analytics, leveraging tools such as AWS, Azure, Databricks, Snowflake, R, Python, and modern data visualization and business intelligence platforms. As a bioprocess engineer and data scientist, I combine technical rigor with computational and digital innovation to strengthen manufacturing strategies and accelerate the delivery of transformative therapies.

## Current
**Principal Engineer, Data Science — Cell Therapy Development & Operations** (AstraZeneca) · Sep 2024 – Present  
[See full career timeline →](/career/)

## What I do
- Translate complex experimental and manufacturing data into regulator-ready analyses and CMC narratives.  
- Design and implement statistical frameworks (equivalence testing, tolerance intervals, variance components).  
- Build scalable data systems (Snowflake, Databricks) and cloud-native pipelines (AWS, Azure).  
- Develop NGS and bioinformatics workflows (Nextflow, Python, R) and interactive dashboards for decision support.

## Selected highlights
- Led process data science and statistics for late-stage cell therapy programs, authoring IND amendment sections.  
- Built Snowflake-based data systems and interactive apps for real-time analytics and predictive insights.  
- Developed single-cell and bulk NGS pipelines used in R&D and assay characterization workflows.  

## Projects & Writing
I write about applied analytics, reproducible pipelines, and manufacturing data strategy. See my [projects](/projects/) and posts for examples.
