# Hi — I'm Nick Orangio

I combine **data science** and **bioprocess engineering** to accelerate biologics and cell therapy development. I build scalable data pipelines, design statistically defensible CMC strategies, and implement digital systems that support R&D through GMP manufacturing and regulatory submissions.

## Current
**Principal Engineer, Data Science — Cell Therapy Development & Operations** (AstraZeneca) · Sep 2024 – Present  
[See full career timeline →](/career/)

## What I do
- Translate complex experimental and manufacturing data into regulator-ready analyses and CMC narratives.  
- Design and implement statistical frameworks (equivalence testing, tolerance intervals, variance components).  
- Build scalable data systems (Snowflake, Databricks) and cloud-native pipelines (AWS, Azure).  
- Develop NGS and bioinformatics workflows (Nextflow, Python, R) and interactive dashboards for decision support.

## Selected highlights
- Led process data science and statistics for late-stage cell therapy programs, authoring IND amendment sections.  
- Built Snowflake-based data systems and interactive apps for real-time analytics and predictive insights.  
- Developed single-cell and bulk NGS pipelines used in R&D and assay characterization workflows.  

## Projects & Writing
I write about applied analytics, reproducible pipelines, and manufacturing data strategy. See my [projects](/projects/) and posts for examples.
